  <h1>Working with programmming languages</h1>
</head>
<body>
  <p> I started learning <a href="csharp.html">C#</a> on a course.</p>
    <p> And I loved to learn how to program.</p>
    <p>I keep learning C#, but when has passed 3 months, I had some knowledge about <a href="sql.html">SQL</a>.</p>
      <p> When I got it, I decided to learn another programmming languages.</p>
      <p>That was my first contact with <a href="html.html">HTML</a> and <a href="css.html">CSS</a>.</p>
      <p>I just fell in love but I thought I'd never learn because it was very complicated for a begginer</p>
      <p>So now I have some more programmming languages to play:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="csharp.html">C#</a></li>
        <li><a href="html.html">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="css.html">CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="javascript.html">JavaScript</a></li>
      </ul>
    </body>
    </html>
